## Overview

![](images/image.png)

In today's world of great technological advancements, effective communication is imperative. To facilitate this process organizations have implemented bots,
using Converstaional AI, to solve complex issues and establish engagement at a personal level.
This bot has been created using [QNA Maker Cognitive AI](https://www.qnamaker.ai/) , [Power Automate Flow](https://us.flow.microsoft.com/en-us/)
and [Adaptive cards](https://adaptivecards.io/) and will allow fellow ambassadors to learn more about the program.


## Setup Information
The [QnA Maker Platform](https://www.qnamaker.ai/) allows you to build, train and publish a simple bot based on FAQs in the form of question-answer pairs, maintained in a well-structured format.
In this sample, we demonstrate how to use the QnA Maker service to answer questions based on the given input.
Details on the solution can be found in the [docs folder](https://github.com/Power-Platform-Samples/Power-Platform-Teams-Sample/tree/main/docs).

## Bot Implementaion and Interaction 

Make a semi-structured document, representing FAQs, in the form of excel sheet or Sharepoint having question and answer pairs.
[QnA Maker](https://www.qnamaker.ai/) uses artificial intelligence to extract relevant question-answer pairs.
It also incorporates powerful matching and ranking algorithms to match a user query with pre-existing questions. In case, no match is 
found, the Admin is notified on his e-mail.
